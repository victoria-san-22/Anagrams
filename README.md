# Anagrams

This is a project I completed in my Software Development class at UA, CSC 210. You can see the overall project description here:



PURPOSE: This program takes in three command line args:
a .txt dictionary file, a word, and a max int. The
program then finds all the possible anagrams for the
given word that can be created from the dictionary words.
words. If a max int is specified, it will only print
anagrams with that number of words or fewer.
